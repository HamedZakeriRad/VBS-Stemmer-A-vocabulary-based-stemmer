 1 | experiment investigate of the aerodynamic of a wing in a slipstream an experiment study of a wing in a propel slipstream be make in order to determine the span distribute of the lift increase due to slipstream at differ angle of attack of the wing and at differ free stream to slipstream velocity ratio the result be intend in part as an evaluate base for differ theoretic treat of this problem the compare span load curve together with support evident show that a substantial part of the lift increment produce by the slipstream be due to a destalling or bound layer control effect the integrate remain lift increment aft subtract this destalling lift be find to agree well with a potential flow theory an empiric evaluate of the destalling effect be make for the specify configuration of the experiment 
 2 | simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small viscous in the study of high speed viscous flow past a two dimension bod it is usual necessary to consider a curve shock wave emit from the nose or lead edge of the bod consequent there exist an inviscid rotate flow region between the shock wave and the bound layer such a situation arise for instance in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate the situation is somewhat differ from prandtl class bound layer problem in prandtl origin problem the inviscid free stream outside the bound layer is irrotational while in a hypersonic bound layer problem the inviscid free stream must be consider as rotate the possible effect of vorticity have be recent discuss by ferri and libby in the present paper the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscous is investigate it can be show that this problem can again be treat by the bound layer approximate the only novel feature being that the free stream has a constant vorticity the discuss here is restrict to two dimension incompressible steady flow 
 3 | the bound layer in simple shear flow past a flat plate the bound layer equate are present for steady incompressible flow with no pressure gradient 
 4 | approximate solute of the incompressible lamina bound layer equate for a plate in shear flow the two dimension steady bound layer problem for a flat plate in a shear flow of incompressible fluid is consider solute for the bound layer thick skin friction and the velocity distribute in the bound layer are obtain by the karman pohlhausen technique comparison with the bound layer of a uniform flow has also be make to show the effect of vorticity 
 5 | one dimension transient heat conduct into a double layer slab subject to a line heat input for a small time internal analytic solute are present for the transient heat conduct in composite slab expose at one surface to a triangular heat rate this type of heat rate may occur for example during aerodynamic heat 
 6 | one dimension transient heat flow in a multilayer slab in a recent contribute to the read forum wassermann give analytic solute for the temperature in a double layer slab with a triangular heat rate input at one face insulate at the other and with no therm resist at the interface his solute be for the three particular case i propose here to give the general solute to this problem to indicate brief how it is obtain using the method of refer 2 and to point out that the solute give by wassermann are incomplete for time long than the duration of the heat input 
 7 | the effect of control three dimension rough on bound layer transition at supersonic speed experiment be perform in the 12 in supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology to investigate the effect of three dimension rough element sphere on bound layer transition on a tained at local match number of 1 90 2 71 and 3 67 by vary trip size position space and reynolds number per inch the result indicate that 1 transition from lamina to turbulent flow induce by three dimension rough element begin when the double row of spiral vortices trail each element contaminate and break down the surround field of vorticity 2 transition appear rather sudden become more violent with increase rough height relate to the bound layer thick 3 aft the breakdown of the vorticity field the strength of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the ensue turbulent flow 4 lateral space of rough element has little effect upon the initial breakdown contaminate of the lamina flow and 5 the trip reynolds number where u and v are the velocity and kinematic viscous at the out edge of the bound layer and k is rough height such that transition occur at the rough position vary as the position reynolds number to the one fourth power viz where x is trip position 
 8 | measure of the effect of two dimension and three dimension rough element on bound layer transition in his study of the effect of rough on transition h l dryden find on the base of available data that the effect of a two dimension rough element such as a trip wire could be represent reason well in term of a function relate between and where is the reynolds number of transition base on distant from the lead edge is the height of the rough element and is the bound layer displace thick at the position of the element at his suggest some addition data be obtain primarily to extend the range to high value of during the course of an investigate of transition on a flat plate conduct at the nation bureau of standard aft the result on the two dimension rough element be obtain it appear to be desire to see whether a row of three dimension rough element would behave in the same way 
 9 | transition study and skin friction measure on an insulate flat plate at a match number of 5 8 an investigate of transition and skin friction on an insulate flat plate 5 by 26 in be make in the galcit 5 by 5 in hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal match number of 5 8 the phosphor lacquer technique be used for transition detect and be find to be in good agree with total head rake measure along the plate surface and pitot bound layer survey it be find that the bound layer be lamina at reynolds number of at least 5 x 10 transverse contaminate cause by the turbulent bound layer on the tunnel sidewall origin far downstream of the flat plate lead edge at reynolds number of 1 5 to 2 x 10 and spread at a uniform angle of 5 compare to 9 degree in low speed flow the effect of two dimension and local disturb be investigate the technique of air inject into the bound layer as a mean of hasten transition be extensive used although the onset of transition occur at reynolds number as low as 10 a full develop turbulent bound layer be not obtain at reynolds number much below 2 x 10 regardless of the amount of air inject a quality discuss of these result is give with emphasis on the possibility of a great stabile of the lamina bound layer in hypersonic flow than at low speed direct skin friction measure be make by mean of the float element technique over a range of reynolds number verify as being lamina over the complete range with air inject turbulent shear be obtain only for reynolds number great than 2 x 10 this value being in good agree with early result of this investigate the turbulent skin friction coefficient be find to be approximate 0 40 of that for incompressible flow for a constant value of r and 0 46 for an effect reynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10 
 10 | the theory of the impact tube at low pressure a theoretic analyze has be make for an impact tube of the relate between free stream match number and the impact and free stream pressure and dense for extreme low pressure it is show that the result differ appreciable from the correspond continuum relate
